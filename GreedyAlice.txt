Greedy Alice is a high-volatility slot game played on a 5-column, 6-row grid. It uses the Scatter Pays system: wins are triggered when 8 or more matching symbols land anywhere on the grid. There’s no need to align them as long as enough matching symbols appear, they pay.
Each win triggers a cascade: the winning symbols disappear, and new ones fall from the top to fill the empty spaces. If new winning combinations form, the cascades continue. This system is paired with a progressive multiplier that doubles with each cascade, starting at x1. The multiplier resets to x1 as soon as there’s no more win or the cascade sequence ends.
During cascades, a random feature called Multiplier Jump can occur — the multiplier may jump up by one level, and this can happen up to three times in a row, giving you a serious boost in potential winnings.
The Free Spins feature is activated by landing at least 4 Scatter symbols, awarding 7 Free Spins, with +2 extra spins for each additional Scatter beyond the fourth — up to a maximum of 11 spins. The Free Spins round works just like the base game, with one major difference: the multiplier doesn’t reset between spins, allowing it to build continuously throughout the entire bonus session. Free Spins are played at the same bet level as the triggering spin and cannot be retriggered.
To increase your chances of triggering Free Spins, you can activate the Golden Bet. This slightly raises your stake (1.2x) but boosts the odds of entering the bonus.
There are also two options to buy Free Spins directly:
-Pay 100x your bet to get a guaranteed 7 Free Spins.
-Pay 200x your bet for a randomly awarded 7 to 11 Free Spins.
As for payouts, wins are awarded when 8 or more matching symbols appear on the grid. Only the highest win per symbol type is paid, but wins from different symbols are added together. The active multiplier is applied to the total win from that round.
